		'Prior Things is driven by the premise that mere intersection is not enough. Reexamining the ways academic departments produce and refine knowledge, this exhibition seeks an alternative. In this space, barriers between fields of study are marked “prior” or expired, their remnants transformed into new forms of practice and exchange.',

		'Bringing together students from RISD and Brown to work in pairs, these collaborations highlight how two individuals form connections that unfold organically and unpredictably. In writing on chance, author and theorist Judith Halberstam foregrounds a rejection of “approved methods of knowing… [in favor of] visionary insights or flights of fancy”. In search of such insights, Prior Things highlights process and mutual exchange over outcome, welcoming the appearance of conflict as opposed to demanding total unity in thought. The pieces presented reject singular frameworks of knowledge and interpretation, inviting viewers into cross-pollinating interests such as alchemy, mythology, oil, environmentalism, and space.',

		'This proposition begins with a leap - to be taken with a grain of salt, with this exhibition as one alternative among many. What other spaces and initiatives might echo our intentions? And how can we possibly dissolve boundaries we are constantly affirming?'
