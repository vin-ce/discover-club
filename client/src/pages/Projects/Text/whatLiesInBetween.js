	body: ['In recent years, map making has become an increasingly popular metaphor for interdisciplinary initiatives in higher education due to its use of both scientific metrics and artistic representations in drawing up the world. The reason why the metaphor works is because in both cases there is a use of analogies to relate reality with cartography in the case of maps and disciplines between one another in the case of interdisciplinary initiatives. (Relate disciplines with reality not truth?)', 'Yet what would happen if we were to take this metaphor seriously and superimpose its two subjects? ', 'We could conduct this juxtaposition in two ways, by looking at the map that emerges from interdisciplinary indicatives, or by looking at what lies between maps, the interspace in and between maps.', 'Mapping interdisciplinary indicatives, or rather, activities in a university is already a popular practice. Often it takes the familiar form of a network graph, connecting distinct disciplines nodes through edges based of “interdisciplinary activity” between the disciplines at a given campus. Essentially, what we see is a relationship being drawn between the “reality” of a campus’ academic activities/ intellectual research and graph theory (a field of mathematics from where the scientific use of networks emerged) to map the complex network of disciplinary collaboration in a campus. The resulting graph encodes “proximity” of disciplines to mean the amount of collaboration happening between two given disciplines, making the resulting graph a sort of “cluster map”  where highly collaborative disciplines bind together with their fellow collaborators in a 2 dimensional plane. This abstract treatment of the disciplines seems to be justified by the fact that they are dealing with fields of “thought” rather than methodologically specialized disciplines.', 'There is a distinction to be made between field of thought and discipline. While a discipline implies the systematic framework through which thought is conducted via set methodologies, standard practices and in reference to a cannon, a field of thought might not be engaged to a singular framework of investigative methodologies, therefor remaining unconstrained from a pre-established practice, yet remaining vulnerable to a lack of rigor or misunderstandings due to inherent openness. This said, a field of thought is often born and shaped by a discipline, and sometimes a discipline may be born from a field of thought, in almost a dialectical manner. Often it will be the case that a discipline will go hand in hand with a field of thought and might be even called the same, but eventually might change name when disciplinary practices diverge or bifurcate due to an innovation in the field of thought, which will inherently remain open regardless of disciplinary divisions and innovative limitations. (Innovative boundaries)', 'As way of an example we could talk about condensed matter in physics as a field of thought where physicists, chemists, computer scientists and even mathematicians might come together to solve a complex problem. Innovative results in condensed matter research might or might not influence physics as a discipline by offering new methodologies to the FIELD of physics to be applicable in other fields of thought put together by the discipline, like astrophysics or high energy physics. Condensed matter might also become in itself disciplinary, if enough methodological tools and field specific jargon is developed it might become unintelligible from other fields within physics, giving it a special rigor to an established field but risking misunderstanding outside of the field. Meanwhile as hinted above, physics itself can also behave as a field where the open questions regarding the mechanisms of nature can be tackled also from philosophical, chemical, biological and theological ways to say a few examples. ', 'Because fields of thought are inherently open, filled with questions to be tackled in anyway whose validity of answers depends on disciplinary standards, their abstraction in the form of a node in a network is possible and even necessary, yet the substitution of a field with its corresponding discipline is not justified. To create a network graph between fields makes sense, although when we denominate a field by a name that can also be considered as a disciplines it gets confusing and misunderstandings can happen. By taking the “field” of physics and linking it in a graph to the “field” of chemistry under the pretense of “interdisciplinary” collaboration is a very ambiguous and misleading action. It seems highly unlikely that the whole field of open questions in physics are being interdisciplinarilly tackled by chemistry also, if this were the case there would be no distinction between the two “fields.” Evidently this is not the case, the collaboration index (how collaborative one field is being with another) is mostly based on interdisciplinary collaboration on specific field question in the form of research projects. Hence the use of ‘inter’-disciplinary collaboration, since the space where the collaboration happens is between disciplines, and disciplines (as I’ve defined them) are defined by their strict methodologies. Then an interdisciplinary collaboration occurs within a field of thought, between disciplines. Why then is the popularized map of interdisciplinary initiatives in universities today a network graph? Is the line connecting the disciplines in a campus representing the spaces within a field where distinct disciplines work together on solving a “field” question? If this is the case, why then would the line shorten as disciplines work more closely? Isn’t this limiting the space of “in-betweeness,” the field space where the question at hand can be tackled? ', 'One option is to do as Brown University in the interdisciplinary mapping of their campus and break up the ambiguous disciplinary nodes into a cluster of smaller nodes encompassed by a name which I understand to be the field of thought. Or in a material sense of the word, an existing department. It is important to note how this “move” to break up an ambiguous whole into parts of a same qualitative type resonates in one sense with our previous definitions of field and discipline, yet is dissonant in another sense regarding the essence of interdisciplinary collaboration. Agreeing with the inherent openness of a field, now countless nodes can be classified under a “field” or “department” name. And regarding a discipline’s strict methodologies, the now nameless nodes make sure to represent the boundaries of a disciplined through the figure of the closed circle and unambiguous through the shedding of their encompassing name which used to confuse itself with the name of a field of thought. The only way to realize interdisciplinary work, is again via network “edges” (the name given to the lines connecting nodes in a network), which are now coded to represent the distance between fields rather than the closeness of collaboration due to the fact that when the field nodes where broken into its disciplinary parts, color coding is necessary to maintain nodes under a same name and also code for inherent proximity between fields of a similar nature. So in the sense of a simple color wheel, STEM fields would go from violet to blue-green and the humanities would encompass yellow to red, having the social sciences occupy a greenish yellow zone between these. This emergent need for further organization once our highly abstract network of arbitrary placed field nodes is broken into its parts hints towards non-arbitrary structure of field proximity which influences the amount of “space” needed for certain interdisciplinary collaborations. ', 'We can see this “space needed” represented in the edge distance between nodes. Where the distance between a blue node and a red node is far greater than that between a green and a yellow node. Yet although these abstractions through networks, color coding and naming seem to provide interesting information on the inherent structure of interdisciplinary collaboration limits and strengths, the act of abstraction through graphical (in the sense of mathematical graphing) representation works against elucidating the essential nature of disciplinary work, and thus as a consequence, interdisciplinary collaborations. The fact that once broken up, our ex-field node became a countless cluster of nameless nodes as to represent what I’ve been calling disciplines, which might be better thought of as disciplinary-field projects, become strangely anonymous once stripped from their problematic over-encompassing name as a whole disciplinary/field node, which we previously regarded as an act of disambiguation. This anonymity reinforces an argument for interdisciplinary collaboration by implicitly stating that every named field contains within its name disciplinary projects of the same form (represented by a closed circle in this case), which can therefore readily collaborate because they share a common form. Supporting this, the shedding of the whole node’s name into the incorporation of a color code, represents a narrowing down of individual identity that was more present with an individual name, yet still differentiates each cluster of nodes. In this case, because the content of each closed circle is different, different types of connections will be possible, yet because the content is related through an external system of representation (that of color coding) a connection will always be possible.', 'This last point is of special concern to me. The fact that an “interdisciplinary” connection will always be possible under the system of relations established under this example of a network graph is problematic, given the fact that first, this system of relations is external to the network itself or internal to a sub-group (network) of the network, therefore becoming inaccessible knowledge to the whole and the real system of relationships, and because it does not take into consideration the material relationships between campus departments, the houses/homes of the fields represented in the network. Obviously, the network of interdisciplinary relationships in Brown’s campus will be an oversimplification of the real thing, especially when posted outside of the student center for all prospective students to admire. That said, it is concerning where the basic system of relations that is being used to advertise the University is coming from, especially when the actual collaborative system of the university is being overtly simplified. We have identified graph theory from mathematics to be the method of representing interdisciplinary collaboration, so naturally the system of relationships will be related to not only graph theory concepts and structures, but to mathematical thinking and analytical thought in general. We’ve established nodes, edges, colors and names to be the basic components of this system, but because these components are being put to use through graph theory, a mathematical discipline if I may, we are narrowing down their use to a very specific context which gives form to our basic system of relations between fields and/or disciplines. The narrowing down of context is the issue at hand because this narrowing down is, in my eyes, done almost always in function of an interest, to put the representation created in function of some end. It turns the system of relations investigated through a given methodology and transforms it into a technology, a means to an end, through the narrowing down of context, to use it as a product, to simply put it to use. In this case we could map out a collaborative effort done between bodies inside as well as outside of our interdisciplinary network that work “together” to produce a system of relations between disciplines that has advertising and profit as its purpose or end. ', 'It is no wonder that STEM fields today are so proliferate and its disciplines are held in such high regard. Scientific research bases itself on the effective use of technologies as means to proving any kind of experimental hypothesis and thus produce more knowledge concerning a certain “natural” question or problem. This is in contrast to the humanities, who deal with open ended questions concerning humanity and the ever-changing questions concerning meaning. The methodologies from modern scientific research naturally pair up with contemporary models for profit making in corporations and capitalist ventures. The idea of effectively and innovatively using available technology to produce capital is at the center of today’s entrepreneurial start-up culture that’s so popular with students. The case is similar with University corporations and private educational institutions in general. In Universities, scientific methodologies are often used across the whole campus to evaluate academic productivity and resource accessibility. Be it through pie-charts or countless forms, the constant quantitative evaluation of academia is not only reminiscent to “quality control” in a factory as argued by Silvia Federici through her “Edu-Factory” idea, but it is also very reminiscent of the scientific method of experimentation and evaluation for the production of knowledge in science. It seems to me that our current subject under analysis, the interdisciplinary network at Brown University, is a very clear-cut collaboration between scientific disciplines within the network they have helped creat and external administrative bodies which perhaps for lack of disciplinary nature, or more precisely, lack of thought provoking questioning necessary for disciplinary work, does not appear in the network of interdisciplinary collaborations on campus. This said, as we can see, there is interdisciplinary collaboration between administration and the fields of thought in the university, and it is actually through this collaborative work that we achieve a public “interdisciplinary” visualization of our campus’ interdisciplinary network. Yet it seems to me troubling that such a powerful figure in the system of relations between disciplines on campus, does not appear altogether in our graph. It is almost as if the frame of the graph, the big piece of plastic where the graph has been printed, represents administrative and staff work in the university, rendering any kind of collaboration intangible without them. Yet this also means that they dictate the framework for said collaborations, and so the narrowing down of context is almost completely under their control. Essentially this means that the way graph theory, nodes, edges, colors and names are being narrowed down into a simple “accessible” representation of the interdisciplinary network of collaboration in the university is almost strictly in function of the interests of administration and, because scientific methodologies are being put to use, scientific inquiry. Objectively, administrative interests are primordially capital interests, and when “scientific” methodologies are put to practice under these interests, it is almost as if the aforementioned production of knowledge is equated with a production of profit. A win-win situation for administration and STEM fields. ', 'The problem with this is not the process of research done to produce such a graph, or the production of the graph itself in view of what is intended by it. This is actually done in a flawless fashion, both knowledge and profit are being produced from said graph. The problem lies in the connection between the graphs methods of representation, the choice of system of relations, and the assumptions, the axioms if you will, made in order to be able to say that the graph is representative of the whole University and its actual interdisciplinary collaborations. The fact that Administration chose to use a mathematical model to represent its university means that by definition it is prioritizing a certain methodology or discipline over others it is representing in the graph. To me this exclusion is highly problematic because it is strategic and in itself also a means to an end, that end being of course capitalization. Because the scientific or mathematical methodology is essentially a closed methodology that purposely uses logics and analysis to propose a problem and solve that and only that problem under certain necessarily assumed axioms for the logics to work. By utilizing these disciplines an administrative body can hold much tighter control over information, knowledge and its representation within the university. On the other hand, open ended methodologies where rather than a formalized problem is introduces to be solved, a series of questions or concerns are explored through critical thinking and writing without necessarily an exact solution, classically understood to be more related to the humanities, are actively avoided by administration because they are not seen as productive methodologies. Because the humanities strive to dive into unconditioned questionings of their research topics, this proves to be dangerous for administrative practices who today axiomatically operate under the guiding light of capital gain. The consequence of this avoidance is a lack of true representation in any network drawn up as a mathematical graph, thus producing an interesting and visually striking model of interdisciplinary collaboration on campus but which does not correspond to the reality of the relationships between departments at Brown. ', 'In the spirit of interdisciplinarity, I propose a solution in the form of a question, what would a map, not a graph, of Brown’s departmental system of relationships look like? I mentioned that another problem with the network graph was that in its abstract representation of the system of relations between field of thought at Brown, it failed to accurately depict the material dimension of such system. I’ve identified the departments at Brown, the actual physical buildings and their placement in the Brown campus as this “material dimension” of said system. Considering this, I will do as administration and choose a discipline to my liking that can provide me a representation of the system of relations between fields of thought at Brown closer to the urban reality of the university campus. I believe architecture and urban planning can offer the best alternative mapping. Architecture is already a site for a lot of interdisciplinary initiatives. The building of a city is not done by one person, it is necessarily a collective effort to build and inhabit a city or even a building, and so designing it must necessarily take this fact into consideration. I think that for any cross disciplinary initiative, the actual physical placement of departments and workspaces in the University campus plays a crucial role in the lasting relationship between the disciplines. Allow me to explain, it can be the case that a single collaborative project between two distant fields is very successful but a lasting relationship does not perdure even after one successful instance of collaboration do to a lack of proximity in terms the spaces each discipline inhabits. The opposite can also be true, where although right next to each other, a kind of isolation is produces within certain spaces so that no collaboration is fostered although spatial proximity is optimal. If we look back at the interdisciplinary collaboration network with its nodes, edges and colors, we would see a lack of congruency when looking at the actual distance between departments and therefore fields of thought. We would see everything much more mixed, yet the fields that would have been of opposite colors that could now be side by side, (take computer science and comparative literature for example), would not have the corresponding weight in their “interdisciplinary” relationship with one another when considering their proximity in space.  ', 'We can’t expect departments to collaborate in interdisciplinary projects only because they are close to each other, but what happens to the spaces where “hubs” of interdisciplinarity, blocks where big diversity of fields of thought are present (at Brown this is especially prevalent due to its small size). In my experience, these spaces become highly transitory spaces, where there is hardly any dwelling in the spaces between disciplines, in part because there is no space to dwell in. This again throws us back to the network graph and its nameless closed circles. Each circle as a discipline is necessarily closed in order to encompass a discipline, and in the case of an equivalent architectural map, a department building is also traditionally a closed structure. How then is interdisciplinary collaboration possible if departments, what we had equated to named fields are physically closed structures just like disciplines are methodologically closed. How may we inhabit the spaces between departmental boundaries (building walls) if these are spaces of transition from one building to another. An urban mapping of the campus shows the paths connecting departments at Brown, essentially designed and built as roads of transition (especially in the winter). It lies then on the student how to navigate the map and produce their personal system of relations. The student then becomes the edges connecting the nodes and rather than proximity in terms of distance, these edges actually become representatives of time dedicated to thinking about the relationship between the connected fields. Yet here lies the biggest contradiction and a sore impossibility! We mentioned how the University corporation sees production of capital and knowledge as a priority (as evident from their used of a mathematical model for the representation of interdisciplinary initiatives at Brown)  and due to its participation in a global market, this production must be competitive, so the higher the productivity, the more successful and profitable is the corporation. If this is so, the training of its students will be consequently geared towards a high level of productivity where quantity is just as important as quality of knowledge produced, since when we talk in terms of money, there is only quantity of money, not quality of money. Considering this, efficiency of production puts a high constraint on time for any student or academic in the University (this is evidently the case from talking to any professor, graduate student or undergraduate students, even high school students experience this lack of time). If administration prioritizes the efficient production of knowledge to capitalize from their faculty, creating a trickle down effect in graduate and undergraduate education, how can interdisciplinary projects between colored nodes that are far apart from each other be possible if no time is available for thinking their connection?
